'''
Find and Replace
In this string: words = "It's thanksgiving day. It's my birthday,too!" print the position of the first instance of the word "day". Then create a new string where the word "day" is replaced with the word "month".
'''
words = "It's thanksgiving day. It's my birthday,too!"
print words.find("day")

new_string = words.replace("day","month")
print new_string

'''
Min and Max
Print the min and max values in a list like this one: x = [2,54,-2,7,12,98]. Your code should work for any list.

'''
x = [2,54,-2,7,12,98]
print min(x)
print max(x)

'''
First and Last
Print the first and last values in a list like this one: 
x = ["hello",2,54,-2,7,12,98,"world"]. 
Now create a new list containing only the first and last values in the original list. 
Your code should work for any list.

'''
x = ["hello",2,54,-2,7,12,98,"world"]
print x[0]
print x[len(x) - 1]
word = []
word.append(x[0])
word.append(x[len(x) - 1])
print word

'''
New List
Start with a list like this one: x = [19,2,54,-2,7,12,98,32,10,-3,6]. 
Sort your list first. 
Then, split your list in half. 
Push the list created from the first half to position 0 of the list 
created from the second half. 
The output should be: [[-3, -2, 2, 6, 7], 10, 12, 19, 32, 54, 98]. 
Stick with it, this one is tough!
'''
x = [19,2,54,-2,7,12,98,32,10,-3,6]
x.sort()
print x
#print len(x)
y = round((len(x))/2)
w = x[:(len(x))/2]
print w
print x
z = x[(len(x))/2:]
z.insert(0,w)
print z
